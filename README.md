This public repository contains **3D Model** of COMSOl, origional **COMSOL Project** files, **Gerber** of our flexible-printed-circuit (FPC), and **Movie S1** of our experiment.

**I. 3D Model**
It contains three marker models, i.e., 1-, 2- and 3- circuit markers. These models were generated into ".stp" formate and can be input directly to COMSOL Multiphysics, which eases others reproducing.

**II. COMSOL Project**
It contains the original COMSOL project. Users can download the project (https://www.dropbox.com/sh/993r2vkm7t0e6di/AAC3tmX515crMaklrrx1C2FHa?dl=0) and open it on COMSOL Multiphysics V6.0. This file is about 22.5 GB and requires a powerful computer for simulation. The performance parameters of our computer are as follows: 1) 64 GB RAM, 2) 2TB SSD, 3) 

**III. Gerber**
It contains all the files for FPC fabrication. As mentioned in our paper, FPC manufacturing should obey the 0.1-thickness standard. 

**IV. Movie S1**
Users can review and download the video from this link (https://www.dropbox.com/s/mem5vcg41ct20cm/Movie%20S1.mp4?dl=0). It shows the global frequency response of three markers, i.e., 1-, 2- and 3- circuit markers, and demonstrates our proposed 3-circuit arrangement can null the frequency splitting.
